This project aims to bring the music freely available on Grooveshark.com to a blog near you.  Rather than going through the widget.grooveshark.com, this is a shortcut command-line script that reads in search terms and automatically posts the widget code to posterous.  This was also developed in connection with another project: http://code.google.com/p/gajaxapis-irc-bot which is an IRC bot that uses google apis.  The 'fringer' version of this bot contains modules grooveshark.pm and tinysong.pm which allow music searches and playlist creation within an IRC chat.

Given search terms at the command-line, these scripts return a shortened posterous URL linking to the embeded player that corresponds to the results of the search.  You must supply a username and password in a separate file "creds.txt" for the posterous part.  Also, unless you become a contributor on the tinysong.posterous.com site, you will have to use your own site details.  If you would like to use tinysong.posterous.com just send me your email.
